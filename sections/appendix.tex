\subsection*{Hierarchies for CheXpert, MIMIC, and Chest X-ray 14}
Our hierarchy for CheXpert and MIMIC is taken from \citet{pham2021interpreting} who in turn use the hierarchy given in \citet{irvin2019chexpert}. For Chest X-ray 14 we use our own hierarchy derived from our knowledge of the datasets. We describe each hierarchy below by giving the parent-child relationships. If $A\rightarrow B$ it means that $A$ is a parent of $B$ in the hierarchy. Classes with no parents are assumed to have their parent as the root node.
\subsubsection*{CheXpert and MIMIC}
Enlarged Cardiomediastinum $\rightarrow$ Cardiomegaly

Lung Opacity $\rightarrow$ Edema

Lung Opacity $\rightarrow$ Consolidation

Lung Opacity $\rightarrow$ Pneumonia

Consolidation $\rightarrow$ Pneumonia

Lung Opacity $\rightarrow$ Atelectasis

Lung Opacity $\rightarrow$ Lesion

\subsection*{Chest X-ray 14}
Pneumonia $\rightarrow$ Atelectasis

Pneumonia $\rightarrow$ Effusion

Nodule $\rightarrow$ Mass

Pneumonia $\rightarrow$ Consolidation

Pneumonia $\rightarrow$ Edema

Fibrosis $\rightarrow$ Pleural Thickening

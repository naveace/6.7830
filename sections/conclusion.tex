\section{Conclusion \& Next Steps}
We have created a tutorial that aims to make PPCA more accessible to non-mathematicians and demonstrate interesting and practical examples. However our tutorial only begins to cover the many applications of PPCA. In the future we hope to expand our tutorial by showing mixture PPCA \citep{tipping1999mixtures} and using the EM algorithm to find posteriors over missing data. We also hope to extend our work to other models such as ICA and factor analysis. We hope that our work inspires others to create additional educational content on PPCA and related models.

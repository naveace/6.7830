D-Man is very, very big-- it looms large. But I was surprised how much

it has shaped the dance experience. - Greeting. JONES: People do it elsewhere,

3:27
- This is a question. I'm sure you've seen everything, but I thought these were always this.
3:32
- Oh. - Going here. - Mm-hmm. - Right? She's doing this. - Yeah, that-- I directed her that way
3:38
'cause I thought that that's what it was, but... - Well, you know what? And... (exhales) Lord knows how many different ways
3:43
it's been done, but I wonder if we might be more consistent if we were to do this. - Okay.
3:49
- And see, and see how that works with the, with the... - Keep it more square, that's the whole... - Pelvis in particular. But now what is it? What's the rhythm?
3:55
And... - One... - (vocalizing rhythm) When you fall, what happens?
4:04
Now, is that-- what if it, what if it was here, fall, da, and then it is quicker. Da, and move, and... (vocalizing rhythm)
4:12
See, that's what I had wanted, that, the contrast between the moments that have lassitude, longueur,
4:17
and those quick things. - Yeah. - You're moving very, very fast, but that shape that, they seem to be making the music do
4:25
what they want it to do. And that's what this was-- right, yeah. Yeah, because in a moment,
4:30
we're going to be right back to this nervousness again. - Right. - Although it shouldn't be nervous, shouldn't be nervous.

Introduction to DMan
6:03
LEBLANC: I just want to give you a little background about D-Man in the Waters,
6:08
in terms of what we will be doing. D-Man in the Waters is a piece by Bill T. Jones.
6:17
To this day, it is considered Bill T. Jones's most successful dance.
6:23
It's quite possible that when you hear the Mendelssohn, it's going to click... (snaps)
6:29
"Oh, classical music, ballet, yeah, right"-- instinctively. It's quite possible.
6:34
So, what I ask you to do is remove that whole notion in your mind.
6:41
This is not a balletic piece. It's lyrical, but it's athletic. Don't think decorative.
6:48
Think you're an athlete, right? You gotta go, just do it.
6:54
Right? Task-oriented, okay? So... Standing here.
7:02
Your right foot behind, plié, as if you're plowing the earth,
7:08
digging into the earth, and lifting it up. Okay?
7:15
As high as you can, looking up at the ceiling. And you drop back. One, up, two, three, four, across.
7:23
I'm going to ask you to walk in. I'll give you a cue to start this,
7:31
and then you're on your own. Okay? Feel the musicality yourself. (Mendelssohn octet playing)
7:44
(music continues) Down. LEBLANC: I became a dancer
7:50
because I saw D-Man in the Waters when I was 16 years old.
7:56
There was a workshop that Bill T. Jones was teaching, and I went to the workshop,
8:02
and I said, "I want to dance with you." (octet continues)
8:07
After that, I became a full-time company member. (octet continues)
8:13
And I performed D-Man all over the world.
8:19
It is the most grueling dance I have ever performed, but it's probably the most exhilarating.
8:28
(dancers applauding) We're going to go away and work and think. You guys are going to go relax and breathe.
8:35
(students sighing, talking) The cast list will be posted at 4:30. Please come, look.
8:41
If you are cast, stay. - I didn't see your name on the board. - Are you... - I'm not nervous.
8:48
Okay. (car horns honking, traffic passing)
8:54
ARTHUR AVILES: There was an audition. You know, I went to an audition, as people do, left Bard College.
Audition for DMan
9:01
And a friend of mine told me that there was this dance company that, um,
9:07
had a great diversity. It was an interesting first day that I had with Bill and Arnie,
9:13
because I came in and they didn't introduce me to anybody, and then they asked me to climb all over Larry Goldhuber,
9:19
who I didn't even realize was in the company. Bill threw his body, and I caught it any way I could.
9:24
Then he would jump backwards and I had to catch it. Then he would say, "Jump to me," and I would jump to him.
9:30
So, we were really... I always felt we were doing actions,
9:36
more than what you would call choreography. - Action causes more trouble than thought.
9:46
Alienation produces eccentrics or revolutionaries.
9:52
BETSY McCRACKEN: Previously, I trained as a ballerina, and a lot of it was about technique. You know, when I started working with Bill,
9:59
all his movements always had some sort of meaning or task to them, and it gave it an honesty.
10:06
Any emotion that came out, it came out of the movement.
10:11
Arnie would go over with some of us, and we would work on something, and then maybe Bill and, would go over and work with someone else,
10:17
and then we'd bring it together. ZANE: Now, here's where he slows down. He lets these shapes be seen.
10:24
Now let that shape be seen. Now, Janet, does Janet have to have two hands there, or can she just do one? LEBLANC: And one, two...
Belly Slide
10:30
Three! Wrap up, wrap, wrap and... (dancers step) And...
10:36
Run back. (Octet playing) Run forward.
10:41
Bow. (octet continues)
10:50
(vocalizing rhythm)
10:57
(vocalizing rhythm) Okay.
11:02
(music stops) Good, not bad. You have all the pieces. Okay, now we're going to learn how to belly slide.
11:09
So, the mechanics are, you are put in, you know,
11:16
like, our push-up position that we work on and you're pulling yourself forward.
11:22
And the shape that you want to... Right, you want to try to keep your legs together.
11:28
Your upper body is up, and your body is actually really taut.
11:35
(dancers laughing) Okay. (applauding)
11:41
(dancers laughing) Good, better. Brandon and Tina will be in the wing together,
11:47
and you're gonna-- eventually, when she runs out, you run right beside her, and then you're going to catch her.
11:53
That's-- uh, whoa, careful. (dancers react) Okay, good. That's the idea, right? Good.
12:01
That-- whoa! (dancers laugh) Okay. Whoo! Okay. (dancers exclaim and laugh)

Not what do you know, but what were you told? So, think back maybe to when you first heard of it.
18:56
TINA: I feel like in high school, like, they just brushed over it really quickly. And, like, it was definitely never something
19:02
my parents ever brought up, but, um... And my friends, we never talked about it. I don't think anyone really knew what it was.
19:08
LEBLANC: When I started learning this piece and I was your age,
19:13
we had speaker after speaker after speaker come in and say to us,
19:21
"Do not touch a body without a condom."
19:26
Now, you can imagine, being 17, 18 years old... You know, you don't go out
19:33

19:39
always in the back of your head, just thinking, like, "Could I die from this?"
19:44
GOLDHUBER: You know, years went by with nothing happening except gay men dying.
Death
19:50
You know, I remember half my phone book had died. GOLDHUBER: In our company, it was Huck Snyder,
19:58
who was a designer, died, and Willi Smith, who had done the costumes, and Keith Haring, who had done the sets, and Alvin Ailey, who had commissioned works, and,
20:06
you know, the list went on and on. In addition to the several dancers in our small company.
20:12
You know, Arnie was one of the first artists to come forward. He did an interview on the MacNeil/Lehrer Report.
20:21
JOANNA SIMON: Recently, Arnie Zane learned he has AIDS.
20:27
We're all going to die! We're all going to die? Can we live through the Joyce season?
20:35
(chuckling): Literally, I remember saying that. "Will I be able to live to my,
20:40
through the Joyce season?" And living with that.
20:46
CURRAN: Arnie worked on graph paper at home in Valley Cottage, and he'd come into Pineapple Studios,
20:52
where we used to rehearse, and he'd have the graph paper, and he'd be in the chair, and he'd, he'd move us around from the chair.
21:01
Oh, it was desperate times. (gentle music playing)
21:21
The day Arnie died, you know, I think Bill called Janet and I and said something like,
21:26
"If you want to see Arnie, you better come quick." But it was almost like a gorgeous religious painting,
21:32
with this person lying there dying, and literally, like a corona,
21:38
the people in Arnie's life around him. LATSKY: I don't think I'd ever seen anyone die.
21:46
You know? And it was like, uh, seeing, um... (voice trembling): ...all of Bill's family, and...
21:53
(sniffles): Then Arnie asking Larry and I to say the Shema. Which, you know, we were all not religious,
22:01
so to actually be, be privy to this very, very personal,
22:07
you know, experience of somebody dying was, uh... (sniffles)
22:13
(voice trembling): That's what I remember. CURRAN: Bill's sisters were there.

- It helped. It helped on that day. That, that whole building, that whole room,
23:12
became silent. When death enters, it becomes silent. And then when Arnie did die,
23:18
I think Bill described it as, he felt a breeze, and I felt sort of a whoosh, something that went up.
23:24
At that time, the ambulance drivers came and they saw this group of weird people crying and mourning,
23:31
and they refused to touch the body. The people wanting to take the body away refused to carry him because they were afraid of him.
23:39
So I believe Bill and, and the boys took, took Arnie out. We had to put him in the bag
23:44
and carry him out to the ambulance. WOMAN: ♪ They are falling ♪

When Arnie passed, then we had the question about, you know, how is the company going to move forward
25:33
and evolved without Arnie? And was it just going to be the Bill T. Jones Company,
25:38
or are we going to keep Arnie's name involved? The company was in trouble. Most of the dance companies were.
25:44
Taxes, everything-- Arnie had been sick for a while. What Bill and I shared was this.
25:51
And because it was so private, he wasn't even at the company, he was at him.
25:58
Could he go on? Could he manage?
26:05
Imagine a relationship where you both are in the same business and you talk through everything, you create everything.
26:13
(Berlioz's Nuits d'Été, "Absence" playing) "So he's gone, and I've got to go on?
26:18
"I've got to, I've got to go on first, without the love of my life." ("Absence" continues)
26:28
Because we always thought Bill was the big guy, the choreographer. But it wasn't, it was Arnie.
26:36
I think Bill had to say to himself, "I'm going to live, and then I'm going to live through my work."
Improvisation
26:45
I don't remember the day we went back into rehearsal after we lost Arnie. I remember the ride home in the car.
26:52
We'd rented a station wagon, I think, and we all just drove back into the city from Valley Cottage.
26:58
But I do remember this overwhelming fear that Bill will end the company. There's no Arnie, Bill will go on,
27:04
be his own artist. We even thought maybe he'd be a movie star or something like... Maybe that's in my head.
27:10
(breathes deeply): Um... But, oh, my God, the sense of relief that Bill would keep the company going. I just remember being so relieved and happy.
27:18
I remember it like it was yesterday. I'm going to get... (voice breaks): I'm sorry.
27:24
Did it begin with an improvisation? Um...
27:30
I, it's amazing how much I don't remember. In the past, you know, sometimes Arnie would throw out a phrase.
27:37
Sometimes Bill would throw out a phrase. This was the first time, I think, ever
27:44
that Bill just put on the piece of music and said, "Just go and do whatever to this music."
27:52
And everybody did. (Mendelssohn Octet playing) And when the music ended,
27:57
we all would gather together and talk about the parts we liked.
28:02
And so the chain in the beginning, where everybody's stepping in front of one another, it just happened.
28:07
(Octet playing) Suddenly, I can't remember who ran out first,
28:12
and then, you know, someone else, like, "Oh, I'll go run in front of them." And I'm, like, "Okay, someone else did that," so everybody was there, like,
28:18
"I'm going to add on, and I'm going to add on," and it just evolved completely naturally. (Octet continues)
28:26
Now, there's a part where we all sat on the floor and it was, like, really cool, and we jumped up, and, like, "Oh, yeah,
28:31
I really liked that part where we sat on the floor." It went on for a while like that
28:36
that day in rehearsal, and it was a lot of fun. It was refreshing. And I think it added
28:43
that spark of happiness and joy that's in the piece. JONES: I remember us being in the studio
28:50
and me asking everyone to contribute how they would go into a body of water.
29:00
(Octet continues)
29:12
CURRAN: Bill said, "I want you to all come up with"-- three or five, I can't remember how many ways-- "of diving into the floor."
29:20
And that's where Arthur's amazing dive into the handstand, roll down the front of the body happened.
29:26
(Octet continues) Something that didn't make it into the piece
29:32
but I have a memory of is that Gregg Hubbard did a very slow sort of adagio thing that he described as
29:39
a very large older woman getting into a pool. (Octet continues)
29:50
AVILES: Yeah, that angry move, that's tantrum, you know? That's, that's not being able to
29:56
control anything, and being able to take it out of your body, you know? One, two, three, four,
30:03
wah, or whatever it was. (in rhythm): I loved doing that! I loved doing that part.
30:08
And whimsical things, like this gesture, which I used to do in a dégagé combination
30:14
in company class, right? And this thing that I could never do that Arthur was so good at, you know? So that's my wave. (laughs)
30:21
(Octet continues) HUBBARD: I introduced the belly slide, and
30:27
Bill liked it. Be careful what you do in rehearsal,
30:32
because then you may end up doing it for a long time. (Octet continues)
30:41
LATSKY: What Bill wanted me to do was run from the wing, jump onto Larry's back, and then jump.
30:49
It was one of the most terrifying things I had to do, and I know that it just frustrated Bill like crazy,
30:56
because... I didn't want to do it. I was so, so afraid of it.
31:03
I just watched whatever documentation-- I hardly got off his back.
31:09
(Octet continues) (audience reacts) I have a feeling
31:16
the people who came after me did it a lot better. (Octet continues)
31:32
There's one part where there's a trio for myself, Gregg Hubbard, and Betsy McCracken,
31:40
and it's just so moving. (slow section playing) I'm sure that I cried many times
31:47
performing this. (slow section continues)
32:01
The trio that I'm remembering, it's all about being held and falling
32:06
and trying to get up, and people supporting you. So I was, you know, in that instance,
32:12
I was the one who was falling and needed support.
32:18
(Octet continues)
32:39
There's references to that everywhere, everywhere throughout the dance,
32:44
that are so beautifully subtle. They're clear, you know? They're clear, it's clear what we were doing
32:52
and what the images represent, but it's not, like, hitting you over the head, you know?
32:57
There's this joyous celebration of survival, but at the same time,
33:03
there's all this falling and being carried and struggle.
33:08
Throughout. (Octet continues)
33:16
And I think the genius of D-Man in the Waters also is that there are moments where it's just so beautifully
33:22
poignant and sad, and then moments, just, like, it just keeps going and going,
33:28
and it's exhausting for the dancers, so the metaphor is just in the physicality of it as opposed to showing it.
33:39
(Octet continues)
33:48
JONES: We were very abandoned and lost and afraid.
33:53
There was some healing, cathartic ritual in the making and the doing of this dance
34:00
that sustained us. We were hurting, but we,
34:07
our work was a way that we kept going. I know it was the way I kept going.
34:14
There's a place to grieve. A place to grieve.
34:20
(Octet continues)
34:27
There's a moment when it tips, and I well up,
34:34
and I call it the Hallelujah place, which is what I'm feeling right now. That is religious, that's spiritual,
34:43
and that's what I want the piece to get to. (Octet continues)
34:50
(ensemble shouting) (Octet continues)
35:00
PERFORMER: Go! (Octet continues)
35:06
(Octet ends, ensemble shouts) (people talking in background)
Safe Spaces
35:16
WOMAN: I'm third, right? (people talking in background)
35:26
LEBLANC: So, um... Do most of you agree, this idea of, like,
35:32
community being strongest for your generation
35:38
when it's online, when it's social media? Yeah, we're all connected through social media,
35:44
but it's, like, it's not like we use that to, like, get a group of people and, like, "Hey, like, let's go fix this."
35:50
I think that's where we might lack in that sense. So, I'm curious, it brings up this idea, this question about safe spaces
35:57
and where they are, you know? And whether the safe spaces end up being virtual spaces.
36:03
And if they are, does that virtual safety move anything?
36:09
Can it move anything, or does it create stasis? WOMAN: I feel like it depends on if the issue
36:15
is something that, like, pertains to me, because, like, like, I'm White, so, like, I don't feel as, like,
36:20
when stuff that happens with the Black Lives Matter stuff, like, I don't feel as, like, scared when I walk out the door, because it doesn't necessarily affect me as much.
36:27
But, like, if I hear about, like, a campus rape or something, like, then that's when I get scared, because that's more likely to happen to me.
36:33
LEBLANC: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So, I'm going to, um, just kind of go a little on
36:39
unchartered territory right now. Just turn and face the person next to you.
36:47
And I want you to just reach out and grab a hand of the person.
36:53
And now just let the, the room, without losing each other's hands,
37:00
just let it kind of breathe open a little bit. So take a step away from each other.
37:10
And keep the tension, pull yourselves away from each other as far as you can go.
37:15
If you feel me tap you, I'd like you to just begin to go down, to sit.
37:21
Okay? Stay pulled away from each other.
37:30
And down. Keep the tension, keep the tension, keep the tension, keep the tension. Okay, and break and rest.
37:37
(all exhaling, laughing) When we have this idea of, um,
37:45
"It's happening to them. It's not happening to me, it's happening to them."
37:52
Right? But, if... If it's happening to her,
37:58
right? It's... keep going, keep-- go down, go down, go down.
38:05
It's going to happen to me. Something's going to happen to me. I may still be on my feet,
38:10
but I'm not completely where I was before.
38:20
Hello. LEBLANC: Hi. Here we go. - Yes.
38:26
- (murmurs) - Okay. Thanks, Damon. - Mm-hmm. - So, here's our group, and I just thought
38:31
we should just introduce ourselves. - Hello, hi. - And... (dancers laugh) We can just go down the line.
38:37
Mateo, you want to start? - Yeah. Hi, I'm Mateo. I'm a freshman theater major, dance minor.
38:42
- What part are you doing? - And I'm Larry/Paolo. - Larry, huh? (dancers laugh)
38:47
- Hi, I'm Haley Loeffler, and I'm a sophomore dance and health and human science major.
38:53
And I am Joe and Seán. - Joe and Seán, uh-huh. - Yes. - Hi, I'm Darren,
38:58
I'm a studio arts major, freshman dance minor. And I'm Arthur and Eric. - Interesting, okay. (all laughing)
39:04
- Hi, I'm Kathleen. - Uh-huh. - I am a dance major and theater minor, and I'm playing you, the Bill part. (all laughing)
39:10
- Hi, I'm Tina Dossa. - Hi. - And I'm Heidi/Jenna. - We can start the way you would like to,
39:17
but we are prepared to just kind of show you where we... - Mm-hmm. - ...have gotten.
39:22
- Yeah, why don't you do that? - Okay. - It's a piece you can talk to death. - Yeah. - You know? And I, every time I meet a group of people like this,
39:29
it's so mysterious, because the piece came out of very specific bodies,
39:34
and now that's, like, all over the map. So I'm seeing the director's eye, what she sees.
39:42
So I like to see what it, what is there to match what
39:47
I feel, I remember, and what is really in front of me. Then we can talk.
39:53
Yeah. - Okay, sounds good. - Mm-hmm.
Choreography
40:00
- When you're ready. (Octet begins)
40:22
(both speaking softly)
40:27
JONES: Why is he Arthur? LEBLANC: Because, because I didn't feel that we had a technical ability
40:33
with Mateo. Mateo's never danced before. - Ah, I see. So, I don't think Mateo could handle...
40:40
- Uh-huh. - ...Arthur's part. (Octet continues)
41:03
JONES: They're really getting the, doing the pure length. - Mm-hmm, good.
41:10
(Octet continues)
41:20
Okay, good. (music stops) Thank you, guys. Good job, good job.
41:25
(applauding and cheering) JONES: Let's just look at these for a moment.
41:30
- Okay? - Mm-hmm. - And hop.
41:36
And please do the choreography so I can judge. Good, good.
41:44
There's such discussions about just what that was. (dancer chuckles) Um...
41:49
LEBLANC: Yes. We said already, this is, like, you know, the surface of water. BRANDON: Okay.
41:55
JONES: All right? WOMAN: Okay. JONES: Now, the surface. But I still don't feel-- I feel the sides of... That's right. BRANDON: Okay.
42:01
- Right. The surface, the surface. Right?
42:07
Here, here, let's, do this. The sur-- okay, you feel that, right? That, yeah.
42:13
The surface. And da! (vocalizing rhythm)
42:18
And then there's a little Fred Astaire in it, as well. (dancers laugh) Okay, so who's next? Let's see another.
42:32
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Okay, rest, rest.
42:38
Okay, now... Um, this is... You're doing a very good job, but this is where, really where the, your, the...
42:45
You've never had this kind of combination before. You're bigger than that person. You know, I, I'm, I don't want to be misogynist,
42:52
but I think I'd like to try you to work with him for a moment. BRANDON: Okay. - Yeah. Because I think you can do it,
42:57
but could you just, on the back, and what I want is, uh, to push him off. - Okay. - And...
43:05
That's right! Yeah. Yeah. (applauding) Now, what was that? Is that because of the height of the man,
43:12
and the distribution of, the way the legs and it works? Let's not belabor it, but I think that's the questions
43:18
I'm have, I'm asking about casting choices? - Mm-hmm. - You know? - Mm-hmm. Height.
43:24
- Because she is just, she's really at a disadvantage. - Right. - Because she's shorter. - Yeah. - And she's smaller. - Right. - For her to be able to
43:29
hoist like that. - Right. - So we'll finish today's rehearsal, then you can talk, and you can think about it. - Okay.
43:35
- Everyone's doing very well, though, very well. - Okay. - Let's go on, then. - Okay. - Yes, Arnie had died.
43:41
Yes, AIDS was everywhere. Yes, we were working through the plague.
43:49
But now the whole thing is, the piece was my response to the plague.
43:55
It never is that clear. What were the discussions around AIDS? AIDS was a guilty disease.
44:03
They almost deserved it. Guilty diseases. Um, so, you, stigma.
44:12
Now, what was D-Man? We should be musical, we should be charming, you know.
44:18
And we're, we're, we're... Mourning. All at the same time.
44:25
What is D-Man? Is it alive now? Is it a cautionary tale?
44:30
Is it one of inspiration? Makes you want to get all your (muted) together, your community together, take responsibility,
44:38
be beautiful, be fierce. Is that what it is?
44:43
I don't know what it is. But I saw the group today, and I came in the room,
44:49
and I thought, now, how do they get to that shouting moment at the end? What is this instant community that Roz is bringing
44:56
together in this dance department? What do they share that is so big,
45:04
so tragic, that you need a piece like this to move it and give it, like, body?
45:12
Is it about ISIS? Is it about rape on campuses? What, what is it about?
45:19
For me, I would say gun violence on school campuses is something that hasn't necessarily
45:25
affected me personally, but at the same time, it is a bit personal because it's happening to kids at school, kids at colleges.
45:34
I'm already getting emotional just talking about it, but... JONES: We're with you, we're with you. - Every time a shooting happens,
45:39
you see it on Facebook, you see it on the news, and it just blows over.
45:44
There's, I feel like there hasn't been a sort of realization of what's happening yet, because it's...
45:51
You said something earlier about becoming calloused. I feel like... JONES: Calloused on the heart, I said, and on the consciousness. - Yeah.
45:57
I feel like that's, that's somehow already happened. With some things, such as gun violence and shooting,
46:03
you see that and you'll think, well, maybe that person deserved to die, or what were they doing in order to get to that point?
46:09
Same thing with a disease-- well, how did they get that? How did they come to that point in their life where they were put in a position to acquire this?
46:16
And then you think, do they deserve that? Did they do something in their life where karma came around and said,
46:22
"This is what's going to happen to you"? So in that sense, there's definitely a parallel between them. - Well, I appreciate the expansiveness of it,
46:30
but I thought that gun violence points to another kind of cancer.
46:35
Something is wrong with us as a society that people go off the rails.
46:42
Once again, it's something about the personal responsibility, what I might have done, that makes this what I have lost,
46:51
which makes that last circle in D-Man particularly powerful, and particularly about art being used
46:58
for something cathartic in the artist, that is potentially shared with the community.
47:11
So do you want to stand up? (all laugh)
47:21
The young, right? Biologically predisposed to hopefulness.
47:29
Bring it. All right, all right, let me see your hands, yeah?
47:36
Yeah. The basic human is, it's, "I give up"
47:41
or "I have nothing to fear." All right.

I love you, I love you. (applauding)

LEBLANC: So overall, he said that you were very unaffected.
49:08
You're not embellishing, you're not acting, you're doing the choreography. And that's a really high compliment from him.
49:16
He had suggestions for how to move forward. And it's my duty to honor those
49:24
and to, at the same time that he trusts me as a director and to guide this the way it needs to go,
49:32
he also has-- it's his dance. (chuckling)
49:37
So I have to honor his wishes. So he has suggested or asked
49:44
that we switch your parts. So that will mean that Darren
49:51
will be the Larry person, and Mateo, you'll be the Arthur person.
49:58
So, uh, it's, considering how far we've gotten, it's an overhaul,
50:06
that we have to just kind of go back and redo. And I ask all of you to just be gracious,
50:13
because it's going to take a while to kind of go back into what we've already done,
50:19
but be gracious, open-hearted, and just, we'll let it happen.
50:26
(people talking in background)
50:31
MATEO: I mean, I've been dancing for a while, since about eighth grade, but it was self-taught-- break dancing,
50:37
and then eventually a little of bit hip-hop. (Octet playing) On top of, like, learning the sequence,
50:42
I'm also learning some of the moves that everybody else already knows. LEBLANC (vocalizing rhythm): And pull in!
50:49
And right and left and right and spin. Now, just a quick lesson in dance.
50:56
(music stops) So a chassé is like, your, uh, back foot chases your front.
51:03
Yes, exactly. - And then, and then, to do the next one, you just... - Step in front, right. - And then... - Yes, exactly. - Great, so there's no...
51:10
- You know what it is, is, it's a gallop. - Yeah. - Now, have you ever heard of spotting?
51:17
- Yeah, I've heard of it. - I, do you know what it is? - Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. - Okay, so your eyes find a fixed point.
51:25
- Uh-huh. - And you find that point again. Okay? Yes, exactly.
51:30
Ready? And two, two, two, two. That's much better, right.
51:36
I love how game you are. You just are jumping into this piece that is
51:43
major modern dance choreography. (laughs) And you've never had any training. I just, my heart is open to you.
51:54
So they went into rehearsal. Also in the room was Demian Acquavella.
51:59
Demian was a really standout person, um...
52:07
Partly because of his just absolute beauty. (dancers chuckling)
52:13
D-man is Demian, and D-man was what Demian was called in the company, just as a nickname.
DMan
52:21
JONES: It's as if now, in memory, it's like Demian sort of came out of the mist.
52:27
Like I say, I don't remember if it came from an audition. I believe it was an S&M world that he traveled in.
52:36
And yet he did ballet, he was a dancer. I knew that he was around town,
52:42
and working with different choreographers, and he fancied himself a choreographer in the making. He told me he was working with a woman choreographer,
52:49
and they were doing the story of Adam and Eve. (classical piano piece playing)
52:56
He was not a naturally fluid dancer.
53:01
His greatest strength was his eccentricity. I've heard, at least Arthur tells it,
53:07
Arthur Aviles tells it, that Janet Lilly was the one that used to call him D-Man.
53:12
I actually called him D-Man, which I, you know, was something that, uh, that,
53:18
something that my family had always used as a way of making... You know, families make nicknames for people.
53:24
He was good at shapes, good at making, like, sculpting kind of...
53:30
Oftentimes, as I remember, this was Demian, very much Demian. This, the demonic, you know, in his mind.
53:38
He was always a boy, but always a bit of a devilish boy. And the dancing was also that way.
53:45
(ragtime-style piano playing)
53:52
CURRAN: When I first met Demian, I did not like the guy. I was very jealous, I think.
53:57
He was so clever and interesting and talented. (music playing)
54:02
I didn't feel like Bill was going to replace me. I think Demian joined the company, I'd been in the company maybe two or three years,
54:08
but I definitely felt, here's another guy who's my height, and he had a better body,
54:15
and he was more interesting, and, you know, the new guy.
54:21
Bill and Arnie had a new color to play with. He didn't have stretchy feet,
54:27
he wasn't super-flexible, but this was a guy who drew your eye.
54:33
Bill brought Demian and I together and said, "I want you to go off and make a duet with this adagio phrase,
54:39
"but you have to do the whole thing with your foreheads touching." And as I remember, there was also an instruction
54:45
that we had to get down onto the floor and get back up, staying connected by our foreheads without using our hands.
54:51
So, of course, we relished the challenge, wanted to make some fabulous duet.
54:57
As I remember it, it sort of brought Demian and I together, this intense intimacy of looking into each other's eyes,
55:04
forehead to forehead, sweat pouring down our face.
55:10
Demian? Oh, my God! You got to remember now, I'm a Christian.
55:16
I'm, I just had my first grandchild. I'm just giving a little background. There is this guy who looked like a little leprechaun.
55:25
He had the spiked hair, and he loved to wear skirts
55:31
and boots, combat boots. My biggest and most profound recollection of Demian
55:38
is dancing on top of a car with an Irish kilt on, and he has nothing on underneath,
55:44
and he's spinning, and he's turning flips, and I'm, like... JONES: I remember him leaving rehearsal.
55:52
Is that right? (chuckles): It was funny, he always wears combat boots.
55:58
It was the summertime. He was always, like, strip for action. I think he was leaving rehearsal in a tutu.
56:06
CURRAN: On a morning off or a day off, Demian and I went thrift store shopping. And we bought matching parochial schoolgirl uniforms
56:14
that we proudly wore with combat boots and bulky socks, but no underpants.
56:19
And we realized at the gay bar that if we did châiné turns, the skirt would flare out,
56:26
and you could see our flopping little (muted), yeah? And this thrilled us to no end.
56:32
♪ That's what I remember, the fun.
56:38
Oh, my God, we had such great fun. That kind of fun is gone now.
56:45
There's, there's not that kind of fun anymore. ♪
56:54
The Jones/Zane Company was on the road, and we had a couple of days off, so of course we found a space
56:59
where we could rehearse. We might have been working on the first section of D-Man in the Waters, I, maybe, I think so.
57:06
But at the end of a long, sweaty rehearsal, Demian and I went back to the locker room
57:11
or the dressing room, whatever it was, and we took a shower in a big, open kind of locker room shower.
57:18
And he very nonchalantly lifted his arm and said, "Seán, what do you think this is?"
57:25
And I looked at it, and I knew exactly what it was, but I said something like,
57:30
"Oh, I don't know, is that a bruise? Did somebody grab you in a partnering duet or something?" It looks like a thumbprint, right?
57:38
And we sort of dismissed it. And as we walked out to the front of the building
57:43
to wait for the van to go to the hotel or go to dinner or whatever we were doing, I said, "Oh, I forgot something."
57:49
By the time I'd come out, Demian was fast asleep on the steps.
57:55
I took my little Instamatic camera out of my bag, and I took a picture of Demian asleep on the cold stone steps.
58:04
And in my head, and in my heart, I knew there was a fork in the road. This was the beginning of the end.
58:14
("Pace, Pace, Mio Dio" from La Forza del Destino playing) HUBBARD: I just auditioned, I didn't realize that it was
58:21
a ten-person company. One person had health issues that would then lead to them not being a part of it,
58:28
and then I would step in and assume some of their roles. (aria continues)
58:37
I show up in New York, and it's my first big dance company job, and I'm elated, I'm so eager.
58:43
But then it's so bittersweet, because very... I didn't know initially, but really soon,
58:49
I understood that my position in the company
58:55
was made possible, made possible because of Demian's illness. So, you know, like, when you want to impress,
59:02
you want to go in and, like, do your best. But I just really wanted to give him this... Because I, I'm pretty compassionate,
59:10
I just knew that, that I had to be really, I had to hold his hand and walk with him, and then not only...
59:16
I'm gonna, I don't know why I'm going to cry. (exhales) I had to...
59:27
(exhales): I had to do it. With him.
59:34
Did I even see him once cry with frustration when he had begun to realize that...
59:40
Was he, because he was a fighter, he was going to fight this thing, that he was going to beat this thing,
59:46
and then sort of realizing that he was not going to beat it.

Kind of the only thing that registered to me was that I had had a dad, a mom, and a sister.

1:05:15
LATSKY: He was pretty sick, and he looked pretty sick. And I think that was one of our concerns
1:05:23
about, you know, should he be on stage or not? Um, also, you know, just,
1:05:31
he was having dementia, and so he was unpredictable. I didn't know how it was going to be done,
1:05:37
but I told him, "You will be on stage at the Joyce." It was a big deal, you know, the Joyce season, as it is now.
1:05:45
So I had promised him that he would be there. Now, I think it was spontaneous, "Come on, Demian, let's do this."
1:05:50
(slow section of Octet playing) That night, it was about him, I remember.
1:05:58
(Octet continues)
1:06:17
Bring him on, and he was not able to walk, and he was very thin. And I put him in the, throw in that place wherein
1:06:24
the Bill character sits down. (Octet continues)
1:06:38
You know, in his mind, he was dancing and he was talking. (tempo picks up)
1:06:45
I remember the music changing.
1:06:51
I had to communicate somehow. I said, "Now, Demian, now, the arms." And so this was all he could do, right?
1:06:56
So I said, "Go for it." And so I was improvising as he was doing that, and I took him off.
1:07:03
(Octet playing at faster tempo) Truly, it was not calculated at all. It was a promise made, and we were a community,
1:07:11
and he was not only our member. He was D-Man-- there was Seán, there was Arthur, there was Heidi, there was Demian or D-Man,
1:07:18
who was our D-Man. And I felt like it was a very important moment.
1:07:23
(audience applauding) I didn't know for years how big it had been. (applause continues)
1:07:36
(Octet playing)
1:07:55
All of those men that were really struggling with it, I saw them as fighting, fighting for something, struggling.
1:08:02
(Octet continues)
1:08:10
Arnie had "lost his fight," but there were people like Demian who were in the waters struggling.
1:08:26
It was a way of saying, "This piece is going to be an ass-kicker and it's going to be about what it takes to live."
1:08:35
It was saying, "You go," as we all were determined to go,
1:08:40
"not easy into that dark night." (Octet continues)
1:08:56
Yeah, D-Man in the Waters, he is swimming and he is swimming brilliantly, and...
1:09:03
Yeah. Yeah.
1:09:09
(Octet playing)
1:09:35
(applauding)
1:09:46
LEBLANC: How'd it feel? - Not awful. - Not-- yeah. - I thought I was gonna forget everything
1:09:51
when I went through the wings, but it stayed together. LEBLANC: Good! Now...
1:09:59
The piece is a shell of itself. Right? The form is here.
1:10:07
Um, the function isn't. So, at every moment--
1:10:16
and we talked about this, and let's talk about it again. You're doing everything right.
1:10:21
You're doing all the steps, you're doing them in the right time. Your, your entrances are great,
1:10:27
the execution is great, but I don't have a sense of why. So Anna in the duet, right? Beautiful.
1:10:36
You're right there, but, but you're not seeing him, right? You're not seeing him.
1:10:42
Even when you go into this, he's behind you, right? You feel him behind you.
1:10:47
And what I see is, right? You're thinking about the, the rond de jambe, and this and this, right?
1:10:55
But him, right? This flesh and blood, like, you're leaning against him.
1:11:02
Like, this is the person you need, like, that part I'm missing. Um...
1:11:08
So... Why? Why are we doing it?
1:11:14
Why? What are, what, what... What are we desperate for? What are we...
1:11:25
What is our AIDS right now? For me, it's just been, recently in my life,
1:11:30
a lot of people have been turning on me. And every time I come to rehearsal, I have a sense of community here.
1:11:36
So I feel comfortable. So I'm, like, happy doing the piece. So every time I do it, I think about all those people who "were my friends,"
1:11:42
and then decided that they were just gonna switch on me and start being rude, and just, like, change their perceptions of me and it makes me angry.
1:11:48
But then I look at everybody's face when I'm dancing, and that kind of takes me out of it. So that's what I'm using. - Okay.
1:11:55
But I'm going to ask you to go bigger. Like us, us, us!
1:12:03
Including them-- what are we going through? What's happening?
1:12:11
(voice cracking): Do you understand what I'm saying? Like, what's happening right now that is going to make
1:12:16
this piece be more important than anything else you do?
1:12:22
What is it? What is it?
1:12:30
What's happening?
1:12:37
Bring them in. You know? It's not-- yes, it's about you, right?
1:12:44
But it's got to be about them, too, it's got to be about us. Where are we? Who are we right now? Yeah!
1:12:50
- I want to say that, like... It... Like, just looking on social media and everything,
1:12:55
like, I'm tired of people always assuming things about people.
1:13:01
Nothing ends up happening because everyone disagrees about how to get it done. Everyone thinks getting rid of guns will, will solve the issue.
1:13:09
People think having more guns will solve the issue, it's... Nobody can come together and compromise and try to figure out,
1:13:14
because everyone has their opinion of how the right thing to do, to do the better thing. I don't even, like, talk about politics
1:13:19
with any of my friends, honestly. And even on, like, just deciding what I want to do, like, after college, like, I have no idea
1:13:26
and I don't know, like, what I'm going to love. LEBLANC: I mean, you are all of the same generation. And what I hear is...
1:13:34
(exhales): Stasis, I hear this inability to make a decision, inability to do anything, to move anything,
1:13:41
to make any difference, to make any changes. Um, right? So all of this is about this, getting stuck.
1:13:48
We're stuck-- what you were talking about, right? Of, like, just, you hear this, all this bicker, all this banter on Facebook, and it means nothing.
1:13:56
Yeah? It's just chatter, right? Empty noise that's not doing anything. So can D-Man do it?
1:14:03
Can D-Man be the place all that frustration that you guys feel, of, like,
1:14:09
this is just, nobody's opinion matters here, nobody's going to vote, nobody's going to do anything,
1:14:15
they're just going to like things, and they're gonna, you know, say their opinions and spout it off because it's easy--
1:14:20
can D-Man be the place for each one of you, that you break through that?
1:14:26
That you actually move? D-Man has to be the place that you as individuals move this,
1:14:33
that no one else is moving, right? No one else is doing it, that's what I hear. Your generation isn't doing it.
1:14:39
So the nine of you are going to do it, and you're going to do it each night on that stage.
1:14:45
That's the place, yeah? That's what it needs.
1:14:50
And the stakes have to be as high as they were for Bill T. Jones and Arthur Aviles and Heidi Latsky.
1:14:58
(Octet playing) They're not the same stakes, but they have to be as high.
1:15:14
(Octet continues)
1:15:44
JONES: There will always be generations of people decimated by some scourge,
1:15:49
be it war or illness-- always. I took this to be our World War I. (Octet playing)
1:16:01
That's what I thought it was.
1:16:07
Gave me solace-- made me angry, but gave me solace that this is the way it works.
1:16:12
There are tragic events that in some ways define generations.
1:16:20
A work of art, if it is bold enough, it is cared for enough, maybe it could even trans, uh, transcend that era.
1:16:33
LEBLANC: Do you dare to let the stakes really be high? Do you dare?
1:16:40
Do you have what it takes to handle it when the stakes are really that high?
1:16:51
Okay, so we're going to do a run one more time. (Octet playing)
1:17:12
(Octet continues)
1:17:39
Good, that was good the way Tina just exited. (Octet continues)
1:17:52
Right, really see him, Anna. Feel him, see him. (Octet continues)
1:18:03
Good, it makes such a difference, doesn't it? Oh, my gosh, it, that's what it needed!
1:18:10
It's amazing. (Octet continues)
1:18:18
Oh, that was great! And... (vocalizing rhythm)
1:18:24
And move! (vocalizing rhythm) And walk! (vocalizing rhythm) And!
1:18:29
(Octet continues)
1:18:45
Good!
1:18:57
Deeper in your legs here, everybody.
1:19:04
(Octet ends) Good! Oh, my God, that was so much better! (cheering and applauding)
1:19:10
Yay! Great! Great! Great! You know what I started to feel?
1:19:17
You guys agree, right? It was so, there, it was... We could feel it now.
1:19:23
The dance was affecting you and moving you, and it was so much better.
1:19:29
Anna, letting the head go, letting the head rest on Brandon's shoulder there was all we needed, you know?
1:19:37
Kathleen, look with your eyes at Tina. - Okay? - Like, do it now.
1:19:42
Now come back to me. Now look with your face to Tina.
1:19:48
- Still eyes. - But I can't tell... - Yeah, that's okay. - ...which one you want. You want eyes or... - I want face.
1:19:54
So look with your eyes to Tina. - I don't know why it's making me
1:19:59
so emotional right now, sorry.
1:20:05
(chuckling) - It's okay-- because it's real. - (crying)
1:20:15
- Okay, so look at me. - Sorry. - Why are you... It's real!
1:20:21
So look with your eyes to Tina. Just your eyes so you can see. Now come back to me, now look with your face.
1:20:30
With your face, yes. You feel the difference? - Yes. - Yeah? This is choreography, right?
1:20:38
This is Tina. - Seeing. - You really see her and that's what that means.
1:20:44
When you turn, you look with your face. You look with your face. The dance comes into you, it's real, it's real life, right?
1:20:53
Yeah, that's what it's about. That's, yeah. - (laughing) - Those are tears of joy because you're finding it.
1:21:03
- (talking softly) - (laughs) - Get out of here, go soak in a bath...
1:21:08
(all chuckle) Okay? Thank you guys so much. It was so good. (applauding)
1:21:14
Yay, awesome! CURRAN: The dance is giving nutrition to those people who are doing it now, whether they know it or not.
1:21:21
It's galvanizing and, um, it is a kind of spiritual nutrition.
1:21:28
The music, the choreography, the performing of it.
1:21:33
It makes for a rich life. (Octet playing)
1:21:41
AVILES: You know, it felt as if someone was taking me through some really harsh, difficult times and, and places,
1:21:50
and pushing me to come through to the other side. CURRAN: Well, you know, nobody gets out alive.
1:21:58
We're all going to die at some time. Yeah, it's just a question of when. So this idea of survival, you know,
1:22:05
is silly when it comes down to it. And I think when we were making and doing D-Man in the Water,
1:22:13
there was a clear idea that some of us are gonna get through with this and some will not. (Octet continues)
1:22:37
The ones who are not gonna get through with it we have to care for and nurture and love, and, and then, you know, let them go with love.
1:22:47
But the ones who are going to stick around, how are we going to get through this? How are we not going to dissolve into grief?
1:22:56
Maybe it is an impossibility, but the dance worked.
1:23:02
(Octet continues) JONES: D-Man can do that.
1:23:10
And it's when that community are working as one...
1:23:18
(voice trembling): And they are part of all other communities that have gotten there,
1:23:24
and I am ready then to let the work go in the world. - One, two, three. (exhale)
1:23:32
JONES: I personally believe in a concept called spirit.
1:23:37
And I also believe that there is a great mystery in the universe that we can know.
1:23:47
I can feel it, I can feel the contours of it. And I would say to my dancers, "Okay, we're going to bring it.
1:23:54
We got to bring the god into the room."
1:24:02
At the end of D-Man, how do you bring the god in it?
1:24:07
LEBLANC: And all the way up to ceiling, sky, heavens above.
1:24:13
(Octet playing)
1:24:21
JONES: This is the goal that the choreographer has set. Do you know how to get there?
1:24:28
Can you bring it?
1:24:34
When I moved like that, um,
1:24:39
and few things in my work do that and few things in the world do that,
1:24:48
and then I feel Hallelujah... (Octet continues, ensemble shouts)
1:24:54
JONES: ...I am redeemed. (Octet ends, ensemble shouts)
1:25:02
(Octet playing)
